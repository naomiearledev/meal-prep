# Claude ADR System Guide

**A comprehensive Architectural Decision Record system designed for AI-assisted development workflows**

## Overview

This ADR (Architectural Decision Record) system is specifically designed for projects where AI assistants (like Claude) work alongside human developers. It provides structured decision tracking, context preservation, and branching strategy integration that scales from small chores to major architectural changes.

## Key Principles

### 1. **Every Branch Gets Documentation**
- No decision is too small to document
- Small changes can have significant future impact
- Complete decision history prevents context loss

### 2. **AI-Friendly Structure**
- Structured metadata for quick parsing
- Cross-references enable relationship discovery
- TOML index provides fast lookup and filtering

### 3. **Branching Strategy Integration**
- ADRs organized by branch type (feat/, chore/, docs/, fix/)
- Natural progression from development workflow to documentation
- Merged branches archived with full context preserved

### 4. **Context Preservation**
- Complete decision rationale captured
- Alternative options and trade-offs documented
- Implementation details and lessons learned preserved

## Core Components

### 1. ADR Index (adr-index.toml)

The TOML index serves as the system's brain, providing:

- **Fast Lookup**: Quick access to any ADR by branch name
- **Cross-References**: Related decisions and dependencies
- **Categorization**: Group decisions by domain (performance, testing, etc.)
- **Metadata**: Created dates, authors, PR numbers, merge status
- **Tag System**: Flexible filtering and search capabilities

```toml
[active.feat]
"tower-redis-client" = {
    file = "feat/tower-redis-client.md",
    created = "2025-01-17",
    author = "Claude",
    tags = ["tower", "redis", "client", "middleware"],
    pr = 15,
    description = "Tower-based Redis client with middleware"
}
```

### 2. Branch ADRs

Each branch gets a comprehensive ADR following a standardized structure:

**Meta Section**: Branch name, type, status, PR links
**Problem Statement**: Context, goals, and non-goals
**Decision Record**: Options considered, chosen solution, rationale
**Implementation**: Key changes, testing strategy, migration plan
**Investigation**: Research findings, experiments, dead ends
**Challenges & Solutions**: Technical and process challenges
**Impact Assessment**: Performance, user, maintenance, security impact
**Quality Assurance**: Code review notes, testing results
**Outcome & Lessons**: Results, performance data, lessons learned

### 3. Cross-Reference System

The index maintains relationships between decisions:

```toml
[relationships.depends_on]
"feat/tower-redis-client" = ["feat/large-payload-testing", "feat/property-based-testing"]

[relationships.enables]
"feat/large-payload-testing" = ["feat/tower-redis-client", "performance-optimizations"]

[categories.performance]
branches = ["feat/large-payload-testing", "feat/tower-redis-client"]
```

## Workflow Integration

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Create Branch**: Follow standard git-flow naming conventions
2. **Generate ADR**: Use template to create branch ADR file
3. **Update Index**: Add entry to adr-index.toml with metadata
4. **Work & Document**: Update ADR as implementation progresses
5. **Final Review**: Complete ADR before merge
6. **Archive**: Move to merged/ directory post-merge

### During Development

- **Update Progress**: Keep ADR current with implementation
- **Document Decisions**: Add new insights, trade-offs, challenges
- **Link Related Work**: Update cross-references as relationships emerge
- **Capture Lessons**: Document what worked, what didn't, why

### At Merge Time

- **Final Update**: Complete all sections, add final outcomes
- **Update Index**: Mark as merged, add merge date
- **Archive**: Move ADR to appropriate merged/[year-month]/ directory
- **Update References**: Update any dependent ADRs

## AI Assistant Benefits

## Scaling Considerations

### Small Projects (1-10 branches)
- Simple directory structure
- Basic cross-referencing
- Manual index maintenance acceptable

### Medium Projects (10-50 branches)
- Helper scripts become valuable
- Category system important for organization
- Regular cleanup of merged branches

### Large Projects (50+ branches)
- Automation becomes critical
- Advanced tagging and filtering needed
- Consider retention policies for old ADRs

## Implementation Tips

### Starting Simple
1. Begin with basic template and index structure
2. Focus on consistency over complexity
3. Establish routine of updating ADRs during development
4. Regular review and improvement of the system

### Growing the System
1. Add categories as patterns emerge
2. Develop helper scripts based on common tasks
3. Create project-specific templates for recurring work types
4. Consider integration with code review processes

### Avoiding Pitfalls
1. **Don't Over-Engineer**: Start simple, evolve as needed
2. **Maintain Currency**: Outdated ADRs are worse than no ADRs
3. **Focus on Value**: Document decisions that matter
4. **Keep Templates Updated**: Evolve format based on usage
5. **Prevent Duplicates**: Regular directory audits to catch file duplication
6. **Plan Migration**: Don't let legacy content accumulate without organization

## Migration and Consolidation

### Common Legacy Content Patterns

When adopting this ADR system in existing projects, you'll likely encounter:

**Scattered Decision Documents**
- Design docs in various formats and locations
- Email threads with architectural decisions
- Wiki pages with outdated decision rationale
- Comments in code with design explanations

**Duplicate Content**
- Same information in multiple files/locations
- Different versions of the same document
- Legacy docs that should be archived

**Organizational Debt**
- Files in wrong locations
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Mixed purposes in single documents
- Unclear file ownership and maintenance

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
```bash
# 1. Inventory existing documentation
find . -name "*.md" | grep -E "(design|decision|architecture|context)" > inventory.txt

# 2. Identify duplicates
find . -name "*.md" -exec basename {} \; | sort | uniq -d

# 3. Check for scattered content
grep -r "decision\|rationale\|chose\|alternative" --include="*.md" .
```

#### Phase 2: Content Triage
**Keep and Migrate**: Valuable decisions that should become ADRs
- Clear architectural choices with rationale
- Design decisions that affect multiple components
- Technology selection decisions
- Process decisions that set precedents

**Archive**: Historical content that shouldn't be lost but isn't active
- Old design docs that informed past decisions
- Superseded approaches and their lessons
- Completed project retrospectives

**Consolidate**: Duplicate or fragmented content
- Same information in multiple places
- Partial decisions across multiple documents
- Related decisions that should be linked

**Discard**: Content that no longer adds value
- Outdated technical specifications
- Superseded and irrelevant decisions
- Incomplete or abandoned design work

#### Phase 3: Systematic Migration

**Create Migration Tracking**
```toml
# migration-tracking.toml
[legacy_content]
"old-design-doc.md" = { 
    action = "migrate", 
    target_adr = "feat/new-architecture.md",
    completion = "pending"
}
"duplicate-context.md" = {
    action = "consolidate",
    keep_version = "docs/context/main-context.md",
    completion = "done"
}
```

**Execution Steps**
1. **Verify Before Removal**: Always diff duplicate files to ensure they're truly identical
2. **Preserve History**: Move rather than delete when content value is uncertain
3. **Update References**: Search codebase for links to moved/removed files
4. **Document Changes**: Update project documentation about new structure

### Real-World Consolidation Experience

Based on the resp-parser-rs consolidation, here are proven patterns:

#### Duplicate Detection and Resolution
```bash
# Proven approach for finding and handling duplicates
for file in $(find .claude -name "*.md" -not -path ".claude/branches/*"); do
    basename_file=$(basename "$file")
    # Check if same-named file exists in subdirectories
    find .claude -name "$basename_file" -not -path "$file" | while read duplicate; do
        echo "Potential duplicate: $file vs $duplicate"
        diff -q "$file" "$duplicate" || echo "  -> Files differ"
    done
done
```

#### Safe Migration Process
1. **Verification First**
   ```bash
   # Always verify files are identical before removing
   diff file1.md file2.md
   # Check for any references to the file being removed
   grep -r "file1.md" . --exclude-dir=.git
   ```

2. **Gradual Execution**
   - Remove clear duplicates first (lowest risk)
   - Handle legacy content migration second
   - Update references and documentation last

3. **Document Everything**
   - Create consolidation plan before starting
   - Track what was moved/removed and why
   - Update directory documentation to reflect changes

#### Lessons from Practice

**What Worked Well**
- **Systematic Approach**: Plan first, execute methodically
- **Verification Steps**: diff checks prevented data loss
- **Clear Categories**: Easy decisions (duplicates) vs complex ones (legacy content)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive tracking of changes and rationale

**Common Pitfalls**
- **Rushing Removal**: Always verify before deleting
- **Missing References**: Search entire codebase for file references
- **Legacy Value Uncertainty**: When in doubt, archive rather than delete
- **Incomplete Migration**: Finish one category before starting another

**Best Practices Discovered**
- **Branch Alignment**: Consolidation work fits perfectly with "cleanup" branches
- **Immediate Benefits**: Directory clarity improves navigation significantly
- **System Maturity**: Clean structure signals production-ready system
- **Cross-Project Value**: Clean examples help adoption in other projects
